# Calculate Volume with the Washer Method
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/vgao1/Volume-Washer_Method.git`
2. Move into the app directory: `cd Volume-Washer_Method`
3. Compile Java code: `javac Main.java`
4. Run program: `java Main`
5. When the program starts running, the terminal will print:
  Input coefficients of quadratic (a,b, and c) where y = ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c\
  a: 
6. In the terminal, type the coefficients of a quadratic and line.
* Type a number and hit "enter/return" key to continue
* Make sure the line and quadratic intersect at two points.  
8. Input the value of axis of rotation.  The axis of rotation is a horizontal line (y = `<value>`) and `<value>` must be greater than the maximum or less than the minimum in the interval of intersection.
* To view images in the animation with the best resolution, type coefficients with smaller magnitude and an axis of rotation closer to the printed bounds.
9. Hit "enter/return" key after typing a number for the axis of rotation to start the animation
10. Example Run:\
    a: 1\
    b: -2\
    c: -3\
    m: 2\
    y-intercept: 6\
    Axis of rotation: y=20
